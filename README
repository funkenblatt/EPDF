Emacs PDF Library

This library is intended to allow elisp programs to deal with PDF
files.  The main motivation behind this is to allow users to do such
things as viewing the outlines and annotations of a PDF file while
using docview-mode.

Things it does not do:

* Work in a robust manner
* Handle character encodings
* Anything particularly useful

I'm concentrating on that last bullet item at the moment.
